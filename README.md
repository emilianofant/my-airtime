## Technologies/Tools used
- React

## Instalation:

### Requirements:
To install the application, `npm` version > 10 is required.
If you have `nvm`, you can run `nvm use` or `nvm i` to satisfied that requirement.
Also, I'm using `npm` but you could also install dependecies using `yarn`.

### Steps to install:

1 - Install dependencies
```$> npm i```

2 - Run the application in development mode
```$> npm run dev```

If you want to build the app:
```$> npm run build```
